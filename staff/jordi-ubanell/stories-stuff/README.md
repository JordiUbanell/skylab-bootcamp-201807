## [Documentation](docs/README.md)


I have the idea to do this project based in my afficion to find selected objects in the Wallapop app, i collect some amazing vintage objects and some stories arround (you can find literally anything of anytime there). This amount of things also make me conscient of object we buy and discart and our ecologic ////// empremta ecol√≤gica. 

This app it's created to aflore and make visible all these lived stories arround this mithic objects that make a emotional engage by some reason. 

The target are on one side the people, afficionates, collectors, nostalgics who want to share these batallitas. The other target are the brands of these legendary objects. 



Llevo un tiempo fascinado por las cosas que encuentro en Wallapop, pero sobretodo con las historias que hay a su alrededor
